# Security Requirements and Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security requirements and guidelines for the CleanSlate mobile application, which handles sensitive data wiping operations.

## Data Wiping Standards

The application should implement multiple industry-standard data wiping algorithms:

- DoD 5220.22-M (3-pass)
- NIST 800-88 Guidelines
- Gutmann method (35-pass)
- Random data overwrite
- Zero-fill

## Security Principles

### 1. Secure by Design
- All data handling operations must be secure by default
- Minimize attack surface area
- Fail securely

### 2. Data Protection
- No sensitive data should be stored in logs
- Memory containing sensitive data must be securely cleared
- All operations must be performed in secure memory regions

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- User authentication required for sensitive operations
- Role-based access control
- Secure session management

### 4. Cryptographic Requirements
- Use industry-standard encryption algorithms
- Secure key management
- Proper random number generation

## Compliance Considerations

- GDPR compliance for data handling
- Industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
- Local data protection laws

## Testing Requirements

- Security testing for all data wiping functions
- Penetration testing
- Code review for security vulnerabilities
- Verification of successful data destruction

## Incident Response

- Procedures for security incidents
- Logging and monitoring
- Breach notification procedures
